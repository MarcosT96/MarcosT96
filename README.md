## Hi There, I'm Marcos! 👋

I'm a Senior Backend Developer 🚀 from Rafaela, Argentina 🇦🇷

I have a strong passion for creating scalable, efficient, and optimized solutions that meet the highest standards of quality. My journey has been driven by a continuous learning mindset, always aiming to improve and deliver better products.

Besides coding, I enjoy playing soccer ⚽, going for runs 🏃‍♂️, and dancing 💃.
